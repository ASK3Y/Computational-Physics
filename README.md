# Computational Physics
Welcome to the Computational Physics class GitHub repository!  
This is where youâ€™ll find all the assignments for the course.

This course is organized in two parts:
* Introduction to Python
* Computational methods in physics

The introductory tutorials in Python are written as interactive Google Colab documents. These tutorials have code blocks built into them that let you pracitice your coding skills. 

Later in the class, we'll be developing more sophisticated projects using other coding environments such as Anaconda and the Spyder editor. 

Structure of the GitHub repository:
* Course syllabus
* Resources - Folder containing Python and numerical methods resources
* Python_Tutorials - Folder containing Google Colab documents
